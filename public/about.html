<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Antonio Vallez Jr. but most call me "Pop". I was born in 1979 and grew up in San Jose, CA. This is in the south
  of the San Francisco Bay Area. I am proudly Mexican American. 
</p>

<p>I am a beginner web developer with big dreams of becoming a creative professional. I was originally motivated by wanting to create
  a website for my own photography and art. I started with the template site providers but found that I need more, a lot more. I am a 
  perfectionist in many things that I do, so there is so much I wanted my own website to provide. So here I am, now creating a simple 
  portfolio with html. This is a huge step for me and i'm actually really proud of myself. I can't wait to learn more and create more.
</p>

<p>My other interests and hobbies include: Bird and wildlife photography, Street photography, portrait photography, pencil drawing, and 
  oil pastel art. I've been a photographer for 15 years now and love every second of it. I've been drawing since I was about 6 years old
  and still love that as well. I still have big plans for my oil pastel art and hope to really get that going too. If you're reading This
  I would like to thank you for your interest and hope you enjoy my work. I really do put my soul into it!!</p>
